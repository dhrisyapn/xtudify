# XTUDiFY

Xtudify empowers students to conquer their studies with a focus on organization and efficiency.  This user-friendly application allows students to create a structured learning plan by adding and organizing subjects, modules, and even individual topics within each subject.  As students master each topic, they can mark it complete, providing a visual record of progress and keeping them motivated throughout their academic journey. Xtudify goes beyond simple to-do lists, fostering a structured approach to studying that ensures students cover everything from broad subjects to the most intricate details.
